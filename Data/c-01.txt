Alex: Alright, everyone. Let’s kick things off. Thanks for joining today’s meeting. The main agenda is to discuss our roadmap for the next four quarters for our HRTech software. Please, let's try to keep this focused and productive.
Jordan: Sounds good, Alex. Do we have an outline of what features we're planning to introduce? I know we’ve kind of talked about AI integrations for recruitment processing.
Sam: Sorry to interrupt, Jordan. Before we dive into AI, can we revisit the feedback on our current UI/UX? I think it’s vital we address that alongside new features.
Alex: Totally agree, Sam. That’s on our agenda too. Let’s categorize our discussion: current issues, upcoming features, and then enhancements, including UI/UX. Jordan, you can get us started with AI features after.
Chris: Before Jordan starts, quick thing, Alex. Do we have an understanding of how these updates align with our market position? I mean, are we leading with these or playing catch-up?
Alex: Excellent point, Chris. We’re aiming to lead in automating recruitment but also ensuring our existing features are top-notch. Now, Jordan, please go ahead.
Jordan: Right, so, regarding AI in recruitment, we’re looking at introducing features like automated candidate screening and AI-driven job matching. However, uh, we’re still in the preliminary stage, needing to dissect how deep our AI capabilities should extend for phase 1.
Sam: That sounds interesting, Jordan. Will the AI also handle initial candidate communications? I think there was some user feedback suggesting we implement a more interactive system for candidates.
Jordan: Yes, Sam, we’ve considered that. The idea is to implement a chatbot for initial interactions. However, the challenge, um, remains in making it feel less robotic, more… human-like.
Taylor: Speaking of bugs, not directly related, but we should ensure these new features don’t introduce any major issues. We had quite a few bugs reported last release. It affected user satisfaction, especially with the payroll module.
Alex: Absolutely, Taylor. We plan to allocate more resources to QA this time. Now, about the payroll bugs, Sam and Jordan, any updates on those?
Sam: Oh, yes. Um, we noted the issues were primarily due to, uh, some backend changes that weren’t accounted for in the front end. So, my bad, essentially. We’ve patched most of it as of last week.
Jordan: Yeah, and I added some extra layers of tests for the payroll module. So, that should help catch these errors moving forward.
Chris: On the marketing side, we should start preparing how we’ll position these updates. The AI integration can be a strong selling point. But we must handle the communications delicately, especially since we're fixing past issues.
Alex: Right, Chris. That’s an important angle. Let’s make sure our messaging is clear that we’re not just fixing but significantly upgrading our capabilities.
Jordan: Um, sorry to circle back, but regarding the roadmap for AI, do we have an estimated timeline? I’m thinking we need at least two quarters to get something solid out, considering we need a beta phase.
Alex: That’s a valid point, Jordan. Let’s tentatively aim for a Q2 next year launch for AI features. This gives us time to refine and test thoroughly. For now, let’s focus on enhancements and addressing current problems in the next two quarters.
Sam: Great, that also gives me time to work on the UI/UX improvements. There were several suggestions from the user surveys that we can implement alongside the AI features.
Taylor: Just making sure, we’re also factoring in the testing cycles for these UI/UX updates, right? We should avoid a repeat of the rush job that happened with the payroll update.
Chris: And marketing will need early access to the updates for promotional materials. The last-minute rush last time almost gave me a heart attack, ha-ha.
Alex: Definitely. Planning and coordination between departments will be key this time. Let’s ensure we have regular updates at these meetings. Alright, we’re almost 30 minutes in. Any immediate concerns before we move to setting specific milestones?
Alex: Alright, moving on. Let’s identify the milestones and assign responsibilities for each goal. We’ll start with the current issues, specifically the UI/UX enhancements. Sam, can you give us a timeline?
Sam: Sure, Alex. Considering the feedback, we’re looking at a comprehensive revamp of the dashboard and navigation ease. I’d say we need about two months to design and prototype. Then, another month for user testing. So, um, roughly by the end of Q2, we should have the new UI ready for rollout.
Jordan: Will you need any specific resources from my team for the prototyping phase, Sam?
Sam: Yeah, Jordan. We’d probably need some API adjustments for the new dashboard widgets. I’ll share the details by next week.
Taylor: For the testing phase, let’s ensure we include both new and long-term users. We need a diverse feedback loop to avoid past oversights.
Chris: I could use the UI revamp in our Q3 marketing push. “New Year, New HRTech” kinda vibe. We should tease the improvements in our next newsletter.
Alex: Good ideas, both. Let’s make sure we sync up on marketing messages with the product team. Now, Jordan, what about the AI integration timeline?
Jordan: Based on our earlier discussion, aiming for a Q2 next year launch seems realistic. It gives us time to develop, test, and run a beta phase. We should start the development in the next quarter. I’ll need a couple of additional AI specialists for the team, though.
Alex: Understood. I’ll coordinate with HR to start the recruitment process for the AI team. Taylor, considering these major updates, how does the QA timeline look?
Taylor: Well, for the UI/UX updates, aligning with Sam’s timeline, QA would need at least a month post-user testing. For the AI features, it’s a bit trickier without having the exact scope yet. But I’d say a minimum of two months for thorough testing, including the beta phase.
Jordan: Makes sense, Taylor. I’ll ensure my team keeps your team in the loop with all development updates.
Chris: For marketing, aligning with these timelines, I’ll prep a teaser campaign for the UI changes to start in Q2 and a full-blown launch campaign for the AI integration in Q2 of next year. Plus, ongoing engagement strategies to keep our audience hooked till then.
Alex: Sounds like a plan. Now, one last thing, let’s briefly address the payroll module issue. Taylor, any updates?
Taylor: Yes, post-Jordan’s and Sam’s fixes, the number of reported issues has dropped significantly. We’re continuing to monitor closely, but it looks stable now. Perhaps, we can consider adding some minor enhancements?
Jordan: Agreed. Let’s not overhaul anything right now, but small quality-of-life updates could be beneficial. I’ll draft some ideas.
Sam: And maybe a refreshed tutorial or walkthrough for the payroll features? Could help with some of the usability feedback.
Chris: Love that idea, Sam. Education is part of marketing too. We can create some quick guide videos.
Alex: Excellent. Let’s incorporate those minor updates into the next quarter, focusing primarily on stability and user education. It’s been a productive meeting, folks. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?
Jordan: Just a reminder for everyone to send their team’s milestones and resource needs by next week. I’ll need those for planning the AI development start.
Sam: Will do, Jordan. And I’ll also share the initial UI concepts for feedback soon.
Taylor: I’ll coordinate with everyone on testing schedules once I have the timelines.
Chris: Expect an outline for the marketing campaigns. Let’s make sure we’re all synced up on the messaging.
Alex: Fantastic. Appreciate everyone’s contributions today. Let’s keep the momentum going and ensure we stay on track with our timelines. We’ll reconvene next week for updates and to finalize resources. Have a great day, everyone!
Alex: Welcome back from the short break, everyone. Let’s dive into the specifics of resource allocation and detailed timelines for each department’s milestones. This will be crucial for hitting our roadmap targets over the next four quarters. Jordan, let’s start with you. What’s your resource plan for the AI development phase?
Jordan: Thanks, Alex. For the AI project, I'm estimating we'll need at least two additional AI developers and one data scientist to strengthen the team. Considering recruitment and onboarding, we should have them in place by the end of next quarter. The development phase should kick off in Q3 and go into Q4, with initial testing starting in Q1 next year.
Alex: Noted, Jordan. I’ll get the ball rolling with HR for the recruitment. Sam, how about design and UI/UX improvements?
Sam: For the design team, I think we’re good on manpower but could use some advanced tools for prototyping and user testing. It’s more about upgrading our resources than adding more hands. As mentioned earlier, we’re aiming to have designs ready for feedback by the end of Q2.
Alex: Got it. I’ll arrange for the tools you need, Sam. Taylor, your plans for ensuring quality across these updates?
Taylor: We’ll definitely need to beef up the QA team, especially for the AI feature testing. I’d say two more QA engineers should do the trick. Also, investing in some automated testing tools would help streamline our processes and catch bugs early on. This should all be in place by Q3 to prepare for the upcoming testing periods.
Alex: Okay, Taylor. We’ll discuss the specifics of the tools you need and start looking for the additional QA engineers. Chris, marketing must have a lot on its plate with these updates coming. What do you need on your end?
Chris: Indeed, Alex. To effectively market the new features and improvements, we’ll need to increase our marketing budget, particularly for digital ads and content creation. We’ll also need to collaborate closely with Sam’s and Jordan’s teams to ensure accurate product information. It would be beneficial to bring in a product marketing specialist focused on our SaaS offerings.
Alex: I see your point, Chris. Let’s detail out the budget increase and start the hunt for a product marketing specialist.
Alex: Let’s summarize and ensure everyone is clear on their next steps. Jordan, you’re coordinating with HR for the AI team expansion and setting the development timeline. Sam, you’ll focus on UI/UX improvements with new tools. Taylor, you’ll oversee strengthening the QA processes and team. And Chris, you’re expanding marketing efforts with a focus on digital strategies and content, along with adding a product marketing specialist to the team.
Jordan: Perfect. I’ll have a draft plan for the AI development by next meeting, including projected milestones and a detailed list of needed resources.
Sam: I’ll get quotes for the new tools and present a timeline for the UI/UX phase by then.
Taylor: I’ll outline the QA expansion plan, including a list of needed automated testing tools and the recruitment process for the new QA engineers.
Chris: You’ll have a proposed marketing budget and a job description for the product marketing specialist role from me.
Alex: Excellent. I appreciate everyone’s input today. It’s going to be a busy few quarters, but with these upgrades and new features, HRTech is poised to significantly enhance its market position. We’re not just solving immediate issues but aiming for innovation and leadership in the HRMS domain. Let’s stay communicative, support each other, and we’ll make this roadmap a reality. Thanks, everyone. Let’s reconvene next week with your updates.
