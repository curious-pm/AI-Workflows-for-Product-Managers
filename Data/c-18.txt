# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Integration for Enterprise Mail Software

## 1. Overview
### Purpose
To enhance security for users by implementing 2FA, ensuring secure access by verifying users through two different authentication methods.

## 2. Objective
- **Primary**: To integrate a robust 2FA system into the current enterprise mail software, reducing unauthorized access risks.
- **Secondary**: To maintain user convenience and accessibility while enforcing additional security measures.

## 3. Scope
- **In-Scope**: Designing, developing, and deploying 2FA functionality for desktop and mobile platforms of the enterprise mail software.
- **Out-of-Scope**: Third-party authentication services management, external database encryption, and hardware tokens provision.

## 4. Assumptions
User's devices are capable of receiving SMS messages or running authentication apps.

## 5. Requirements
### 5.1. Functional Requirements
1. **Authentication Methods Support**: Support SMS-based OTP, authentication apps (e.g., Google Authenticator), and email as secondary factors.
2. **User Enrollment**: Users must be prompted for 2FA setup upon first login post-implementation. Option for later setup is provided but mandatory after 30 days.
3. **Backup Codes**: Generation of backup codes during enrollment for access if primary 2FA methods are unavailable.
4. **User Interface**: Intuitive UI/UX for setting up and using 2FA, integrated into the current software environment.
5. **Trust Device Option**: Allow users to mark devices as "trusted" to skip 2FA on those devices for a specified duration.
6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Detailed logs of authentication attempts, including time, method, and success/failure status.

### 5.2. Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Security**: Ensure all 2FA data transmissions are encrypted using industry-standard practices.
2. **Performance**: Authentication process should not exceed 5 seconds.
3. **Reliability**: 2FA system must have 99.9% uptime.
4. **Scalability**: System should easily handle increases in user volume without degradation of performance.
5. **Localization**: Support for localization in major languages used by the enterprise users.

## 6. Success Criteria
- Reduction in unauthorized access incidents by at least 80% within the first year of implementation.
- User onboarding to 2FA reaches 95% within three months of rollout.
- Maintain or improve current user satisfaction rates post-2FA implementation.

## 7. Implementation Plan
### Phases:
1. **Phase 1 - Research and Planning**: (Duration: 2 weeks) Gather requirements, select 2FA methods, and draft initial designs.
2. **Phase 2 - Development**: (Duration: 8 weeks) Develop 2FA integration, focusing on backend security and front-end user experience.
3. **Phase 3 - Internal Testing**: (Duration: 4 weeks) Conduct thorough testing, including security, usability, and stress tests.
4. **Phase 4 - Beta Testing**: (Duration: 3 weeks) Roll out to a select user group for real-world testing and feedback.
5. **Phase 5 - Launch and Monitoring**: (Duration: Ongoing) Officially launch 2FA, closely monitor system performance, and user feedback.

## 8. Rollout Strategy
- Soft launch for IT and security teams.
- Gradual rollout to departments based on security risk assessment.
- Comprehensive support and training materials availability.
- 24/7 technical support readiness post-launch.

## 9. Dependencies
- Coordination with IT for deployment and support.
- User education and communication plan development.
- Integration testing with current enterprise infrastructure.

## 10. Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **User Resistance**: Implement comprehensive education and support structures.
- **Technical Failure**: Robust testing phases, with contingency plans for rollback.
- **Adoption Rates**: Incentivize early adoption, and enforce mandatory enrollment after a grace period.

## 11. Future Considerations
Explore the integration of biometric authentication methods as technology and user acceptance evolve.
