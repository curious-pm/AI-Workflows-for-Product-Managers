Slack 4.36.138

11 January 2024

Bug fixes

All bugs that were fixed in this release were too small for the eye to see or too fiddly for human words to describe. Nevertheless, work was done, things tinkered with and the app became subtly better.

Slack 4.35.126

6 November 2023

Bug fixes

Nothing major to report this week. Nothing minor to report either, as it turns out. Work is still happening, mind you – it’s just more the sort that happens behind the curtain in between scenes at a play. We’re quietly setting the stage for what’s to come.
Slack 4.35.121

24 October 2023

Virtual machines were causing actual problems for Slack when both were running simultaneously. We're virtually certain we've eradicated the problem with this update.

Slack 4.33.73

28 June 2023

Bug fixes

Intelligent quips often contain depth of thought, but that's not what we mean when we say that smartquotes were presenting a problem for deep links. Punctuation will no longer affect the punctuality of your deep link updates.
Good governance is all about removing roadblocks, which is why we've retooled the sign-in flow for GovSlack. Now when you sign in to a government workspace for the first time, we'll automatically restart the app in Gov mode (instead of kicking you back to the login page). Your Slack dollars at work!
Did you know that clicking on a banner notification will take you directly to the message that triggered it? Had you noticed that recently this feature stopped working? May we make you aware that this is now fixed? Shall we stop writing in rhetorical questions?

See https://slack.com/help/articles/11906214948755
Bug fixes

Double-clicking on the title bar now maximizes all Slack windows, not just the main one. Please enjoy this expansive change.
Ever navigate away from Slack during a huddle, then have trouble finding that window again? Clicking the dock icon will now focus your last-active window, bringing that hidden huddle out of hiding.

“What is this—a video player for ants?” YouTube videos embedded in Slack can now be expanded to play in full-screen mode, which we’re told is at least three times bigger.

Bug fixes

Trying to capture your screen with a third-party app while also sharing your screen in Slack may have resulted in the non-Slack app crashing. We’d like to say that this was because the idea of “capture” is antithetical to “sharing,” but in truth it was just a “bug.”
Security guidance

This release includes minor security improvements. Updating is beneficial.
Slack 4.27.154

14 June 2022

What’s new

You may have noticed that with this release there’s a new, larger number at the end of the version string. Going forward, while you’ll still see the numbers laid out in a <MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD> sequence, the “Build” numbers will now correspond to specific builds on our end as opposed to a small sequential number. TL;DR: A few more numbers for you, a bit more specificity for everyone.
We’ve added the most common Apple and Microsoft file extensions to our approved list so you won’t be asked to confirm each time you open a Word doc or Keynote presentation. Are you sure you’d like one less approval? YES/NO
Bug fixes

If you’re in a locale that does not use the default system string encoding on Mac, opening certain file types would cause a crash in a native dependency that tries to interpret a string passed to it as the system default string encoding. If that doesn’t mean anything to you, well don’t worry because we fixed it.

Slack 4.26.1

4 May 2022

Bug fixes

Slack 4.26.0

25 April 2022

Bug fixes

If you tried to re-download a file that was already present in your Downloads folder, the app would pretend to download it again without actually producing a new file. Duplicitous duplication was never part of the plan—sorry about that.
Security guidance

This release includes minor security improvements. Updating is beneficial.
Slack 4.25.0

24 March 2022

What’s new

Starting today, you’ll see a confirmation pop-up when a link in Slack is prompting another program to open. If you don’t want to see these each time because you enjoy living on the edge, just check the box “Always open files of this type.”
Bug fixes

We discovered that under very specific circumstances (stars being aligned, barometric pressure being just so, looking in a mirror and saying “Slackbot” 3 times), Active Directory users were ending up with a backslash in their Home directory, which was preventing the app from launching. However it happened, all slashes are welcome at the party, so Slack will run as expected now.
Slack 4.24.1

10 March 2022

What’s new

If you've been wanting to use a virtual camera on a video call in Slack, well, now you can! Plug in a custom video feed from your computer, or use a fancy digital camera for crystal clear picture. Daguerreotypes and hand-cranked movie cameras are not supported as input sources at this time.
Bug fixes

We discovered that when an update to the app failed, people were still being notified that the update was a success. There is a time and place for “fake it ‘til you make it,” but this was not one of them.
Security guidance

This release includes minor security improvements. Updating is beneficial.
Slack 4.23.0

7 December 2021

Bug fixes

Those on MacOS 12 reported that notification sounds were still coming through despite Notification Sounds being set to “None.” We have updated the internal logic to the more explicit “None, not under any circumstances, not even if it’s very important, never, not once, nil, absolutely not.” We hope it takes the hint.
Some external URLs were occasionally launching within the Slack app window, but will now load in your default web browser, as is proper. Slack cannot have a little web page, even as a treat.

This release includes security improvements. Updating is recommended.

Slack 4.21.0

20 October 2021

Bug fixes

We were occasionally displaying a message letting you know you had been removed from the desktop beta. However, some of you had never been part of the beta in the first place. We will no longer remind you of things that you are not, or when it is not your birthday, or when there is no update to the app.
Security guidance

This release includes minor security improvements. Updating is beneficial.
Slack 4.20.0

20 September 2021

What’s new

When opening SSH, FTP, SFTP or SMB links, you’ll now see the option to allow all future URLs from just that same domain instead of the whole wide world. A little more secure for us, a little more peace of mind for you.
Bug fixes

Certain versions of the app were not correctly changing availability to “Away” after 10 minutes of inactivity. While this has been fixed, we’d like to remind you that you can use your Custom Status to let your teammates know your whereabouts beyond simply Active or Away. Examples include: walking the dog, catching up after PTO, taking a mental break, or tweeting nice things to the Slack social media team.

Slack 4.18.0

14 July 2021

Bug fixes

Certain menus were not being properly translated when switching languages in the app. You know what they say about menus — they’re most helpful when you can read them.
When the app was told to launch on login but remain hidden, it took those instructions a little too seriously, playing hide-and-seek when it should not. That which was hidden was sought, and the app window will now politely reveal itself when you want.
Slack 4.17.0

3 June 2021

What’s new

Bigger is better, or rather, closer is clearer. We now support additional zoom levels up to 200% to reduce the strain on your precious peepers.

Slack 4.16.0

4 May 2021

Bug fixes

Depending on your zoom level, we weren’t always showing the password field when authorizing the use of a proxy. This, by proxy, made for an unpleasant overall experience within Slack.
Images and notifications were sometimes sharing real estate...inelegantly. We have given them both a talking-to, and they have agreed to joint custody of that section of the screen.
Security guidance

This release includes security improvements. Updating is recommended.
Slack 4.15.0

12 April 2021

Bug fixes

In the Mac app, certain error screens made it very hard to find the part of the window that allowed you to click and drag. To be fair, entire genres of computer games have been built around hard-to-find click targets. Slack, however, is not a game of this genre — so we’ve made the clickable area a bit wider.
Security guidance

This release includes minor security improvements. Updating is beneficial.
Slack 4.14.0

17 March 2021

What’s new

Did you update your Mac to Big Sur? Of course you did, you upstanding citizen. You’ll be rewarded with a freshly-updated Slack icon.
Bug fixes

We improved the restart experience when you’ve gone offline or are having loading issues.
We all have to sign out sometimes. If you sign out of all of your workspaces, you should have an easier time signing back in.
Hopefully you’ll be able to ask “Can you see my screen?” a little less these days. The green border that lets you know you’re screen sharing is back.
Security guidance

This release includes minor security improvements. Updating is beneficial.
Slack 4.13.0

16 February 2021

Bug fixes

When you move or resize Slack, we assume that you are indeed trying to move or resize it – and so the crash that was regularly happening, instead, was unwelcome. We’ve fixed this. Here’s to properly-sized screens!
We’ve fixed several accessibility issues. Making Slack more accessible is a continuous journey, and we’re quite grateful that you’re along for the ride!
Slack 4.12.2

8 January 2021

We tweaked some things too small to notice or too difficult to explain. We’ll return you to your regular, more interesting types of release next time (we hope).

È pronto! Italian language support has landed!
You can now attach recently used files – in one click – from the paperclip menu. Hasty screenshotters, the world is yours.
Bug fixes

Some small, but important, accessibility improvements for those navigating with VoiceOver or a screen reader.
As a dancer gracefully recovers from a minor tumble, so shall our app gracefully reload whilst throttled by network failures.

Slack 4.10.0

6 October 2020

What’s new

Updates mean that Big Sur is totally supported in a very holistic, west coast, chill way. It’s, like, totally gnarly. Or sick! Whichever means “good”, basically.
Bug fixes

Sometimes, you could not exit full screen mode with escape on windows, which was wrong, because that’s literally what escape means. Now, it works.
We fixed some issues that caused window resizing of Slack to be difficult. We never want to be difficult.
Quickly switching workspaces caused problems. Switching workspaces should only cause opportunities, so we fixed that.
There were a few little bugs that caused crashes, like bugs do. We fixed those, and we’ll fix the next ones too.
Slack 4.9.0

2 September 2020

Bug fixes

We’ve tuned the engine and given the interior a thorough clean. Everything is now running smoothly again.
Slack 4.8.0

23 July 2020

Bug fixes

In rare cases, Slack would simply fail to start altogether. While we’re sure we could all use a coffee break, we know you could also use an application that runs. So we fixed that.
We made the screen you see when you have connection problems more useful. We also spruced it up a bit with a fresh coat of paint.
Our notifications system sprung a leak, so we brought it in for a tune-up. Everything should be running smoother now.
Slack 4.7.0

2 July 2020

What’s new

We’ve upgraded all the backend stuff that the apps run on, resulting in better performance and fewer bugs.
Slack 4.6.0

21 May 2020

What’s new

Batten down the hatches! The app sandbox is now enabled for all web content. This is a fancy way of saying we’ve dialed up the security of the app. It wasn’t unsafe before, but it’s double safe now.
A preference that allows you to choose a unique save location per download, instead of choosing a folder for all of them. For the choosy types.
Bug fixes

Downloading app updates is less prone to timing out on slow networks, as we’ve extended the timeout to something reasonable.
The Close button has returned to its rightful place on notifications, for all your dismissing needs.
If you found yourself, in some distant past, trying to start a song on Spotify with your keyboard’s play button, and it did not respond to your command while Slack was front and center, pesky hardware media keys were the problem. And this version is the cure.
The app should be less spicy to your CPU when you’re viewing certain network error pages.
When a download completes, we’ll show an in-app prompt rather than a bothersome system notification.
Slack 4.5.1

13 May 2020

Bug fixes

We’ve tinkered with the internal workings and polished some rough edges. The app is now better than it was.
Slack 4.5.0

1 May 2020

What’s new

We’ve upgraded all the backend stuff that the apps run on, resulting in better performance and fewer bugs.
Our spell checker has been swapped out for a newer model that’s faster, leaner, and capable of fixing your typos in… wait, can this be right? “Multiple languages at the same time”! Open the “Language & Region” preferences to choose your languages. And for whoever it is out there requires that functionality: our hats are off to you. We can barely type in one language right now.
Slack 4.4.2

31 March 2020

Bug fixes

We're always working on performance improvements - and this release repairs a previously broken performance diagnostic tool. You won't notice a difference, but we'll have an easier time improving Slack.
Slack 4.4.1

21 January 2020

What’s new

We've tinkered with the internal workings and polished some rough edges. The app is now better than it was.
Bug fixes

Slack would sometimes crash when the user right-clicked to see the context menu. In context, that was unhelpful. So it no longer does that.
When maximized, the app had developed a bit of a distracting flicker. That flicker is now part of Slack history.
Occasionally, a restart would result in connectivity issues for Slack… now you should be back online and back to work lickety-split.
Slack 4.2.0

4 December 2019

What’s new

Our newest, fastest, best-performing, shiniest, most nutritious and delicious version of Slack is now fully rolled out, so that’s the one you’re now using. Brilliant.
Like zooming in and out? Use a numpad? Great news. You can now do these things, on that.
Bug fixes

Notifications looked weird if your workspace name was long. Now, no matter your team name, notifications look lovely.
Some messages were being marked as read when Slack was hidden behind applications, or not visible on screen. Now we won’t mark it as read until you’ve actually seen it. Which seems fair.
Using three finger swipes to navigate channel history on touchpad now works again. And for those who never knew it could work in the first place: it does!
Slack 4.1.2

18 October 2019

Bug fixes

Long workspace names now no longer appear as incredibly long in menus.
Slack menus should now be showing up in the right language (meaning the one that is right for you).
Spellchecker stopped working for a small number of users, leading to a shorp increase in avoidabull erraz. With spellcheck now fully back online for those users, any remaining typos are officially not our fault.
Slack 4.1.0

16 September 2019

What’s new

Thanks to a few tweaks to the engine, a polish of the pistons, and recalibrated valves, the app should be running smoother and faster, than before.
Spellcheck, revamped, is now a much better version of its old self (and back on Linux, to boot) — now it supports Greek, Portuguese and British English. So now spelling correctly should come more naturally to us all (which is good, because “correctly” can be a difacult word to spell).
Bug fixes

After uploading a video into Slack some found it would give an infinite circle of loading, but not play, which was never our plan. Now: it works! It plays; no more circle! Because, it turned out, all circ and no play made Slack a null ‘ploy.
Slack 4.0.3

28 August 2019

What’s new

We’ve updated all the background things to ensure that whenever a new OS update may arrive, Slack will continue to work perfectly. Or, at least, work as expected.
Bug fixes

Now, when we check for network connectivity, it’s more reliable than it was before. Making for a quicker connection, and less frustration
Slack 4.0.2

7 August 2019

Bug fixes

When opening your computer, Slack is now far more likely to launch reliably. Which is, let’s face it, the very least it should do.
Now when we update the app, we’ll send you a polite little notification alerting you to the fact.
An annoying leak involving in-channel videos has been plugged.
Slack 4.0.1

25 July 2019

Bug fixes

We’ve tinkered with the internal workings and polished some rough edges. The app is now better than it was.
